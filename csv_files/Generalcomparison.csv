ALASKA,Alaska,AK,"Summary: Loss & restoration of civil rights:  Right to vote and serve on jury lost upon conviction of any felony, and restored upon completion of sentence.  Any bar to office linked to voting right also removed. Firearms rights:  A person with a felony conviction (or juvenile equivalent) may not possess a concealable weapon for 10 years following discharge (rights lost permanently if offense is one against the person), unless conviction set aside or pardoned. Pardon policy & practice:  Governor decides; must consult parole board, but board’s advice not binding.  No public hearing; parole board staff investigates, consults with DA and court, and prepares confidential recommendation to governor.  Only three pardons since 1995.  The clemency program has been “under review” and not functioning since 2009. Judicial expungement & sealing:  No provision for expungement of adult convictions.  Most juvenile records sealed within 30 days of 18th birthday, or five years after completion of sentence if charged as an adult. Deferred sentencing and set-aside for certain offenses does not include expungement, but a 2016 law prohibits the state from publishing online the records of such cases.  Non-conviction records are generally unavailable to the public without the consent of the subject of the record.  However, no sealing of non-conviction records unless mistaken identity or false accusation proven beyond reasonable doubt. Consideration of conviction in employment and licensing:  No general law regulating consideration of conviction.  Direct relationship test applied in disciplinary action for medical and nursing licensees."
ARIZONA,Arizona,AZ,"Summary: Loss & restoration of civil rights: All civil rights lost upon conviction of any felony.  Civil rights restored automatically for first-time felony convictions upon completion of sentence and payment of restitution (not fine); those convicted of two or more felonies, or who have not paid restitution, may regain rights only through judicial set-aside or pardon.  People with federal offenses are eligible for relief, but those convicted in other states are not. Firearms rights:  All firearms rights lost upon conviction of any felony; may be regained from the court through a set-aside if the conviction was for a non-violent offense, or from the court two years after discharge. Persons convicted of a “dangerous offense” must wait 10 years. Firearms rights may also be regained through a pardon, though only if the pardon document so specifies. People with first felony offenses eligible upon release from probation, or two years after release from prison.  Those convicted of “serious” or “dangerous” offenses must wait ten years.   May also be regained through pardon. Pardon policy & practice:  Governor decides but may not act without affirmative recommendation of clemency board; governor must report pardons, with reasons, to the legislature.  Public hearing; publication of board recommendation to governor, with reasons.  Pardon relieves legal consequences of conviction, but conviction must still be reported.  Pardons increasingly rare since 1990; Gov. Brewer issued 12 pardons in her six years in office, all in her last month in office.  Governor Doug Ducey has issued no pardons to date. Judicial expungement & sealing: “Set-aside” available from the sentencing court to people with state offenses upon discharge for all but violent and sex offenses; relieves collateral consequences, but conviction must be disclosed and serves as predicate offense.  Juvenile adjudications may be set aside upon reaching 18 years of age and discharge from sentence, except for serious violent offenses; remain predicate offense. Non-conviction records may not be sealed or expunged, but may be amended to note that a person has been cleared of any arrests or indictments that did not lead to conviction. Consideration of conviction in employment and licensing:  Public employment subject to “reasonable relationship” standard.  Ban-the-box in state hiring by executive order.  Disqualification from public employment only if “the offense has a reasonable relationship to the functions of the employment or occupation for which the license, permit or certificate is sought.” Comprehensive 2018 law established standards for occupational licensure linked to public safety, a procedure for obtaining a preliminary determination of eligibility.  Beginning in 2019, licensing agencies must report to the legislature of number of applications and dispositions.  Misdemeanors and non-conviction records may not be considered. Law further amended in 2019 to prohibit consideration of most felony convictions after 7 years.  In 2017 provisional licenses were authorized."
ARKANSAS,Arkansas,AR,"Summary: Loss & restoration of civil rights:  Vote and jury eligibility lost upon conviction of any felony; office eligibility lost upon any malfeasance in office.  Vote restored by completion of sentence; jury eligibility restored by pardon; office eligibility restored by expungement. Firearms rights:  All firearms rights lost upon any felony conviction; restored by pardon, or by sealing/expungement in limited cases. Pardon policy & practice:  Governor decides, but must consult parole board, whose recommendation is not binding; governor must report to legislature on all grants, with reasons.  Board and governor must each give 30 days’ public notice of intention to recommend or grant, respectively, with reasons.  Relieves legal disabilities and is grounds for automatic expungement; pardoned conviction may not serve as predicate or to enhance.  Firearms rights must be restored separately.  Pardons issued regularly, about 100 each year. Judicial expungement & sealing:  Minor felonies and drug convictions eligible for sealing after five years; misdemeanors and certain drug convictions after completion of sentence (presumption in favor of sealing); prostitution convictions as a result of being a victim of human trafficking eligible for sealing at any time (mandatory if found to be human trafficking victim).  Serious violent and sexual offenses ineligible, as are motor vehicle violations committed by holder of a commercial driver’s license. Deferred adjudication for first-time offenses may result in sealing (serious violent offenses and certain sex offenses ineligible). Non-conviction records, including cases where charges have been dismissed, “shall” be sealed by sentencing court unless there is a public safety risk. Expungement available in only two situations:  where non-violent felony committed before the age of 18, and after completion of drug court. Consideration of conviction in employment and licensing:  Under 2010 law, conviction may be considered but may not bar licensing; five years following completion of sentence is “prima facie evidence of rehabilitation.”  Reasons for denial of license must be given in writing.  In 2019 law tightened to prohibit consideration of convictions that have been sealed or pardoned, and provide standards for waiver.  Most convictions may not be considered after 5 crime-free years, and “good moral character” standards prohibited."
CALIFORNIA,California,CA,"Summary: Loss & restoration of civil rights:  Vote lost upon conviction of any felony if sentenced to a term of imprisonment, not including those serving felony sentences in county jail; jury eligibility lost upon conviction of any felony or malfeasance in office; office eligibility lost upon any malfeasance in office.  Vote restored upon completion of prison sentence, including parole; jury and office eligibility restored by pardon. Firearms rights:  All firearm rights lost upon any felony conviction and misdemeanor involving use of a firearm; restored by pardon except when underlying offense involves use of dangerous weapon. Pardon policy & practice:  Governor decides with optional consultation of parole board; for recidivists, board must be consulted and supreme court justices must recommend. Judicial Certificate of Rehabilitation, first step in pardon process, available to state residents after 7-10 years, and parole board must make pardon recommendation to governor within one year of receiving certificate.  Pardon restores civil rights and removes occupational bars but does not expunge record; firearms rights restored separately.  Pardons relatively frequent under Governor Brown. Judicial expungement & sealing:  Courts may dismiss charges or set aside convictions for people who had probation, misdemeanors, and minor felony offense sentences in county jail. Certain minor felonies may also be reduced to misdemeanors and become eligible for dismissal or set-aside, including felonies for which sentencing deferred (“wobblers”). This relief does not seal record, but restores rights and removes disabilities, and has other employment-related benefits.  Conviction may still be used as predicate offense and must be disclosed in certain contexts. Judicial dismissal of charges and set-aside commonly referred to as “expungement,” but no sealing of records except for certain under-age misdemeanors and most juvenile adjudications after five years (if found to be rehabilitated and no subsequent convictions of felony or crime of moral turpitude).  Records of decriminalized marijuana convictions may be dismissed and sealed. Records of human trafficking arrests and convictions may be vacated and expunged after three years.  Mandatory sealing of most non-conviction records upon petition (effective 2018). Eligible juvenile misdemeanor arrest records must be sealed upon request. Certificate of Rehabilitation (COR) available to peoplw with state offenses from court in county of residence or court of conviction after crime-free waiting period of 7-10 years residence, and satisfaction of other statutory criteria.  COR relieves certain licensing restrictions as well as obligation to register as sex offender, serves as first step in the pardon process. Consideration of conviction in employment and licensing: State licensing board may not deny (or suspend or revoke) license solely on basis of conviction if it is not “substantially related” to the qualifications for the license.  It also may not deny based on a felony for which the individual has received a COR, based on a misdemeanor if the person is “deemed rehabilitated” by licensing board standards; or if charges have been dismissed or set aside.  Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act limits reporting by background checking companies. Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) imposes state-wide ban-the-box law for public and most private employment (no inquiry into conviction history until determined applicant receives a conditional offer). Consideration of certain non-conviction records, including dismissed and set-aside convictions, may be an “unfair employment practice” under FEHA and subject to administrative enforcement.  FEHA also requires employers to conduct individualized assessments to determine whether conviction has a “direct and adverse relationship with the specific duties of the job.”  Additional procedural requirements apply in the event the employer decides to reject an applicant based on their conviction history."
COLORADO,Colorado,CO,"Summary: Loss & restoration of civil rights:  Vote lost upon any felony conviction if sentenced to a term of imprisonment; jury eligibility not lost; office eligibility lost while incarcerated or on parole following conviction of any felony.

Pardon policy & practice:  Governor decides with non-statutory advisory scheme; must report pardons to legislature, with reasons.  No eligibility restrictions.  No public hearing; governor must seek views of corrections authorities, DA, and judge.  Pardon restores civil rights and firearms rights.  Pardons infrequent. Judicial expungement & sealing:  Under a comprehensive revision of Colorado’s sealing laws in 2019, most convictions from petty offenses to all but serious felonies, including but not limited to drug crimes, are eligible for sealing.  Eligibility waiting periods range from one year in the case of petty offenses, to three years for misdemeanors and lower-level felonies, to five years for all other eligible felonies.  Minor drug felonies may be vacated and reduced to misdemeanors, making many of them eligible for sealing.  Mandatory sealing of decriminalized misdemeanor marijuana offenses. Non-conviction records must be sealed where charges completely dismissed or person acquitted. Deferred sentencing dispositions may also lead to sealing.  Defendants may move immediately and informally to have records sealed at the time of acquittal or dismissal of all charges, including dismissal pursuant to diversion or deferred sentencing. Under 2017 scheme, juvenile record expungement mandatory in the case of most petty offenses and misdemeanors, or where no conviction results; expungement discretionary for low-level felonies after eligibility waiting period, which is longer for people with repeat offenses. In addition to record-closing relief, sentencing courts are authorized to grant relief from collateral consequences at or after sentencing in most cases. Consideration of conviction in employment and licensing:  Conviction of felony or other offense involving moral turpitude cannot, by itself, prevent a person from obtaining public employment, or from receiving a license or permit required to pursue any profession or business in the state.  In 2018, new language prohibits a licensing agency or public employer from adverse action based on non-conviction records, convictions that have been pardoned, sealed or expunged, or convictions as to which a court has issued an order of collateral relief.  Licensing agencies have authority to grant conditional licenses to individuals with a criminal record.  State-wide ban-the-box for public employment, with some exceptions (no background check until applicant is finalist or conditional offer made).  Certain records (including non-conviction records) may not be considered, and detailed standards apply to consideration of others.  Effective September 1, 2019, state-wide ban-the-box on initial application forms for private employers with 11 or more employees (all private employers by effective September 1, 2021).  At later stages of the hiring process, private employers may consider all criminal history and at any time may review publicly accessible criminal history reports.  Employers protected from negligent hiring suits. General Assembly reviews agency licensing and certification processes to determine whether they disqualify applicants based on criminal history and if so whether such disqualification serves public safety or commercial or consumer protection interests."

  <h3>What are we?</h3>
  <p>A criminal record does not have to define you. Based on your geographic
  location, the Expungenation website will provide information on pardons and
  expungements in your state, as well as nearby legal service providers.</p><br>
  <h3>What is an expungement? </h3>
  <p>An expungement (also called "expunction") is a court-ordered process in
  which the legal record of an arrest or a criminal conviction is "sealed," or
  erased in the eyes of the law. When a conviction is expunged, the process may
  also be referred to as "setting aside a criminal conviction."</p><br>
  <h3>What is a pardon?</h3>
  <p>A pardon, on the other hand, does not clear, seal, or erase a criminal
  record. In fact, on its own, a pardon does not affect the criminal record in
  any way. Rather, a pardon is a way of obtaining official recognition from the
  governor that the applicant has turned their life around. While the criminal
  conviction will still show up on an employment background check, the person
  applying will at least be able to say that they have a certified
  recommendation from the state Pardon and Parole Board.</p>

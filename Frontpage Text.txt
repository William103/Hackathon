A criminal record does not have to define you. Based on your geographic location, the Expungenationâ„¢ website will provide information on pardons and expungements in your state, as well as nearby legal service providers. 

What is an expungement? 
An expungement (also called "expunction") is a court-ordered process in which the legal record of an arrest or a criminal conviction is "sealed," or erased in the eyes of the law. When a conviction is expunged, the process may also be referred to as "setting aside a criminal conviction."

What is a pardon?
A pardon, on the other hand, does not clear, seal, or erase a criminal record. In fact, on its own, a pardon does not affect the criminal record in any way. Rather, a pardon is a way of obtaining official recognition from the governor that the applicant has turned their life around. While the criminal conviction will still show up on an employment background check, the person applying will at least be able to say that they have a certified recommendation from the state Pardon and Parole Board.

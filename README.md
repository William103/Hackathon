# Hackathon
This is a tool for finding information on expungements, pardons, or other
related legal assistance. If you want to run it yourself, you need python 3. An
easy way to check is by typing ```python3 --version``` or ```python
--version``` and if one of those works and says 3.x, then you are good to go. It
also won't run if you don't have the right packages. If you try to run it by
typing ```python app.py``` or ```python3 app.py``` and it doesn't work, it will
complain about lacking a package. To install the package, type ```pip install
X``` or ```pip3 install X``` or ```python -m pip install X``` or ```python3 -m
pip3 install X```. One of those should work.
